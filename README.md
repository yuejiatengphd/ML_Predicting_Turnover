# Using ML to Predict Turnover
This project applies machine learning to predict employee turnover and provide actionable insights for improving retention. Using a variety of predictive models, including Random Forest, the project identifies key risk factors for turnover, such as low employee engagement, lack of recognition, and limited growth opportunities. The goal is to enable organizations to proactively target at-risk employees and implement strategies to enhance employee experience, improve belonging, and increase engagement. The analysis process includes data cleaning, model evaluation, and the development of a framework for measuring the effectiveness of retention strategies.
